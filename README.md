#Welcome to WebGL
Welcome to my extension on the excellent work done at [Learn OpenGL](http://learnopengl.com). What you'll find contained 
within the is respository is a translation of tutorials provided by _Learn OpenGL_ from **OpenGL** to **WebGL**. For the
most part won't attempt to recreate the tutorial,I'll instead provide the code and comment on any major differences between
the two technologies.

###So why read these tutorials?
...

###What will you learn?
We'll focus on WebGL and modern HTML and Javascripting techniques. In other words, we'll be using features of HTML5 and ES6
with no concern for backwards compatibility. We will be teaching you to use WebGL as if you'd be using OpenGL 3.x/4.x.
